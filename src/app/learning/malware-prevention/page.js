          <p className="mb-3">
            Malware, short for malicious software, refers to any software intentionally designed to cause damage to computers, servers, clients, or networks.
            These harmful programs exploit vulnerabilities in systems and can operate covertly, making them difficult to detect until significant damage has occurred.
            The history of malware dates back to the early days of computing, evolving from simple viruses to sophisticated attack vectors capable of evading detection.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Cybercriminals use malware to steal sensitive data, disrupt operations, or gain unauthorized access to systems.
            The motivations behind malware attacks vary widelyâ€”from financial gain through identity theft or ransoms, to corporate espionage, political activism, or even state-sponsored cyber warfare.
            As our dependence on digital systems increases, malware attacks have become more frequent, targeted, and damaging across all sectors including government, healthcare, finance, and personal computing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Types of malware include viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware, adware, rootkits, and more.
            Malware can spread through email attachments, malicious links, software downloads, compromised websites, or even removable devices.
            Understanding malware is essential for safeguarding your digital life, as prevention remains the most effective strategy against these ever-evolving threats.
